# File Name Text Remover Script

This Python script automates the process of removing specified text from the names of all files within the current directory. It's especially useful for batch renaming of files where a common text pattern or string needs to be deleted to maintain consistency or clarity in file naming, without the need for manual editing.

## Features

- Automatically scans and processes all files in the current directory.
- Efficiently removes a user-defined text pattern from each file name.
- Directly renames files in the current directory to their new names without the specified text.
